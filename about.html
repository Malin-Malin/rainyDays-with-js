                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>RainyDays started with a simple idea: to create jackets that make the outdoors enjoyable, no matter
                    the weather. It all began on a rainy hike, when we realized there wasn’t a jacket that could keep up
                    with our love for adventure—without sacrificing comfort or breaking the bank. We set out to change
                    that.
                </p>
                <p>Our mission became clear: design rain jackets that blend durability, style, and versatility for
                    people who love the outdoors as much as we do. Whether you're hiking, skiing, camping, or exploring
                    new places, we wanted to make sure your gear could keep up with you in any weather.
                </p>
                <p>Today, RainyDays offers high-quality jackets that do just that. Our collection is built for people
                    who push their comfort zone and embrace life’s adventures, knowing they can count on their gear.
                    We’re proud to provide mid-range prices, ensuring that staying dry and comfortable doesn’t mean
                    compromising on quality.
                </p>
                <p>Rain or shine, RainyDays has your back.
                </p>
